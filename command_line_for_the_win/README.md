SFTP command-line tool



Steps are below:
After completing the CMD challenge and 
taken screenshorts of the various steps;


1. First I opened the command prompt on my local machine.


2. I clicked on the browser (chrome) and 
loged into my intranet alx account.
 Where I have access to my sandbox.


3. I started the sandbox and then copied the 
host name from the SFTP button.


4. Then I pasted it on the command prompt on
my local machine and clicked enter.

It took me to a newline and prompted me to 
type yes/no to continue or discountinue.

I entered yes and another prompt came 
requesting password and switched to the sandbox
to copy the password.

It finally took me to a newline with the prompt below;
SFTP>


5. I navigated to the /root directory with the 'cd' command.

Then I list the files and directories with the 'ls' command.

It displad all my reos for the alx projects. 

I then cd to the directories 
/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/


6. I uploaded my files(screenshots)with the command 'put' and 
then drag the file from the monitor of my local 
machine to the command prompt shell.

It looks like:

SFTP> put c/desktop/foldername/screenshot.jpg
=============================================================end.
